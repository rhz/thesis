  abstract = {An overview is presented of the construction and
              use of algebraic partition functions to represent
              the equilibrium statistical mechanics of
              multimolecular complexes and their action
              within a larger regulatory network.
              Unlike many applications of equilibrium statistical mechanics,
              multimolecular complexes may operate with various subsets
              of their components present and connected to the others,
              the rest remaining in solution.
              Thus they are variable-structure systems.
              This aspect of their behavior may be accounted for
              by the use of 'fugacity' variables as a representation
              within the partition functions.
              Four principles are proposed by which the combinatorics
              of molecular complex construction can be reflected
              in the construction of their partition functions.
              The corresponding algebraic operations on partition functions
              are multiplication, addition, function composition and
              a less commonly used operation called contraction.
              Each has a natural interpretation in terms of
              probability distributions on multimolecular structures.
              Possible generalizations to nonequilibrium
              statistical mechanics are briefly discussed.},
