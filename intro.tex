\section{Historical background}
In the history of natural sciences,
there has been two main approaches to describe dynamical systems,
which I call here
\emph{Kinetics} and \emph{Thermodynamics}.
Broadly speaking, in the kinetic approach the system is
described by the positions and momenta of each particle.
This approach goes all the way back to
Newton's laws of motion~\citep{newton}.
Intuitively, it is a ``ground'' description in the sense that
it is as explicit and detailed as possible.
If a (classical) mechanical system has $N$ particles
then a state of the system is described by
a vector in $\RR^{2 \cdot 3 \cdot N}$.
% Regarding the role of forces in Newtonian mechanics:
% Interactions producing a change of momentum on a particle
% that can be measured independently do not interact between them
% and thus the resulting derivative of the momentum (force)
% is just the sum of the forces as measured independently.

On the other hand,
the thermodynamic approach shows how
all information about the change of the system in time
is contained in the energy function (for conservative systems).
Given a set of states $\statespace$ for the system,
an energy function $E: \statespace \to \RR$ maps a state to its energy.
In this way a state is described by a single scalar
regardless of how many particles it comprises.
Naturally, this approach endowed the description of
a dynamical system in classical mechanics
with a remarkable conciseness, simplicity and elegance.
It first appeared in the work of
\citet{lagrange2} and \citet{hamilton},
and has been subsequently used as the basis for most of modern physics.
Once in possession of the energy function,
the kinetic description (\ie the equations of motion)
can then be derived from it. % this energy function.
However the converse is not true:
in general a kinetic description might not have an energy function
from which it can be derived, % in the classical framework.
partly because of non-conservative (\eg dissipative) forces.
Obtaining an energy function from the equations of motion
is called the \emph{inverse problem} in classical mechanics
\citep{santilli} and it was first attended to by \citet{helmholtz}.
Both the direct and the inverse problem are the interest of this thesis.
Note that this approach has been given the name `thermodynamic'
not because of thermodynamics,
the science that studies the dynamics of heat and temperature,
but because of the protagonical role of energy
driving the system's evolution.
Certainly, there are connections to thermodynamics
that will be highlighted as they arise.

Half a century after Hamilton's work
researchers like Maxwell, Boltzmann, and Gibbs % several researchers
applied the ideas of classical mechanics to \emph{atoms}
in order to describe physical properties of matter like pressure,
the capacity to transfer heat, and others.
This body of work came to be known as \emph{statistical mechanics}
and was used to explain Brownian motion by \citet{einstein-brownian},
which after its experimental verification \citep{perrin}
settled the debate about the existence of atoms.
This work however did not attempt to explain
the chemical interactions and reactions molecules undergo.
That would have to wait yet half a century
for the axiomatisation of \citet{kolmogorov} of probability theory
and the further developments of \citet{feller} and \citet{doob},
who, among others, established the theoretical framework
for continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs).

\begin{definition}[CTMC]%[continuous-time Markov chain]
  A \emph{continuous-time Markov chain} is ...
\end{definition}

This theory would permit the framing of the dynamics of
chemical reaction systems using mathematics
while the physical validity of using this stochastic approach
was established by \citet{gillespie76}.
% and gave a method, later popularised by \citet{gillespie77}
% in the chemistry and biology communities,
% to realise path-samples of the evolving probability distributions.
As we will see, the approach used by Gillespie falls squarely
in our broad kinetic approach.
However, we should first survey two contributions
that precede Gillespie's work and are important
for our presentation.

Metropolis and Hastings

Petri

A formal language to describe chemical reaction systems
% came to be by the hand of Petri
was invented by \citet{petri}.
This language, later called Petri nets,
would define a reaction as a transformation of
multisets of chemical species.

However, Petri nets as a language for describing chemical reactions
has limitations when we take into consideration
how chemistry actually works.
When we look at what happens during chemical reactions
inside molecules, the chemical transformation amounts to
a change in the way electrons are shared by atoms
resulting in a relocation of chemical bonds.
It's all about atom binding and unbinding,
establishing connections and breaking them.
This is poorly captured by a change  of identity
as it is modelled in Petri nets.

More recently,
a formal language to describe biochemical interactions
where molecules not just react but can also bind other molecules
non-covalently has been created by \citet{danoslaneve2002a}.
