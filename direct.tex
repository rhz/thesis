In this chapter we show how to construct
a set of rules and their forward and backward rate constants
from an energy function.
In the spirit of rule based modelling languages like Kappa
where rules and observables are defined in terms of patterns ---
contact maps $g$ used to compute $\matches{g}{m}$ with $m$ a state.
% primarily used
We assign an energy cost $\cost(g)$ to pattern $g$
and construct energy functions as linear combinations
of the number of ocurrences of each energy pattern $g \in \shapes$.
\[ E(m) = \sum_{g \in \shapes} \cost(g) \matches{g}{m} \]
This is reminiscent of group contribution methods
used to estimate the standard Gibbs free energy of formation
of biomolecules \citep{group-contrib}.







\if0
We suppose hereafter that $\generators$ is closed under
rule inversion, \ie $\generators = \inv{\generators}$.
Hence every $(r,\psi)$-transition
has an inverse $(\inv{r},\comatch{\psi})$
and $\LTS_\generators$ is symmetric.

\section{Linear kinetic model}
\label{sec:kinetic-model}

% is the linear kinetic model related to "Parameters for
% the description of transition states", John Leffler, Science, 1953
% https://sci-hub.ac/10.2307/1680906
% it says "we approximate the transition state as a hybrid between
% the reagent and product states"
% "whenever the plot of the logarithm of the rate constant
%  against the equilibrium constant is a straight line,
%  the approximation is justified"
% "it should then be possible to predict
%  the free energy of the transition state by a linear combination of
%  the predictions made for the reagents and for the products"
%
% if we then relate the free energy of the transition state to
% the rate constants using Arrhenius?
% this has been done in transition state theory
% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyring_equation
%
% do we get additional constraints on kinetic rates from cycles
% in the transition graph? when two cycles share an edge?
