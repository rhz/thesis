Whenever a contact map $g$ is used to compute $\matches{g}{m}$
where $m$ is a state, we say $g$ is a pattern.

In the spirit of rule based modelling languages like Kappa,
our energy function depends on the number of occurrences of a pattern.

% TODO: relate our energy function to group contribution methods
% This is reminiscent of group contribution methods
% used to estimate the standard Gibbs free energy of formation
% of biomolecules.

We suppose hereafter that $\generators$ is closed under
rule inversion, \ie $\generators = \inv{\generators}$.
Hence every $(r,\psi)$-transition
has an inverse $(\inv{r},\comatch{\psi})$
and $\LTS_\generators$ is symmetric.

\label{sec:kinetic-model}

% is the linear kinetic model related to "Parameters for
% the description of transition states", John Leffler, Science, 1953
% https://sci-hub.ac/10.2307/1680906
% it says "we approximate the transition state as a hybrid between
% the reagent and product states"
% "whenever the plot of the logarithm of the rate constant
%  against the equilibrium constant is a straight line,
%  the approximation is justified"
% "it should then be possible to predict
%  the free energy of the transition state by a linear combination of
%  the predictions made for the reagents and for the products"
%
% if we then relate the free energy of the transition state to
% the rate constants using Arrhenius?
% this has been done in transition state theory
% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyring_equation
%
% do we get additional constraints on kinetic rates from cycles
% in the transition graph? when two cycles share an edge?
